    1.    As a user, I want to add a new expense with category, amount, date, and description so I can track my spending.
    2.    As a user, I want to edit an expense in case I make a mistake.
    3.    As a user, I want to delete an expense if it is no longer needed.
    4.    As a user, I want to assign a category (food, bills, groceries, friends, other) to each expense so I can see spending patterns.
    5.    As a user, I want to view a list of all my expenses so I can see what I have spent.
    6.    As a user, I want to see total spending per week or month so I know how much I spend overall.
    7.    As a user, I want to see total spending per category so I know if I spend too much in one area.
    8.    As a user, I want to quickly add expenses on desktop or mobile so tracking is easy.
    9.    As a user, I want to duplicate a previous expense if I pay the same thing often, like a monthly bill.
